# Archlinux

## Introduction
For AUT-ICPC competitions of 2019, an Archlinux iso image was provided. 
So here are some links and explanations for the journey of installing and configuring and having a live image at the end in Archlinux.

## Getting Started

At first I quote a warning from [Archlinux website](https://www.archlinux.org)
[You may __not__ want to use Arch, if](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Frequently_asked_questions#Why_would_I_not_want_to_use_Arch?):

- you do not have the ability/time/desire for a __'do-it-yourself'__ GNU/Linux distribution.
- you require support for an architecture other than **x86_64**.
- you believe an operating system should configure itself, run out of the box, and include a complete default set of software and desktop environment on the installation media.
